# Blinkit Grocery Dashboard – Power BI Project

This Power BI project visualizes fictional retail and outlet data for Blinkit, a fast-moving consumer goods delivery platform. The dashboard is built to provide insights into item sales, outlet performance, outlet types, and customer trends across different store tiers and regions.

All data used in this project is fictional and was self-created to demonstrate Power BI, DAX, and SQL capabilities.

---

## Project Overview

The Blinkit Dashboard focuses on understanding product-wise sales trends, outlet establishment over time, store tier performance, and fat content classification for grocery items. The goal is to simulate how a grocery delivery business like Blinkit can track its sales and outlet strategy across locations and item types.

The data was cleaned and processed using Microsoft Excel, modeled within Power BI, and enhanced using DAX formulas for calculated metrics and aggregations.

## Insights Discovered

- Supermarket Type 1 generated the highest total sales (~$788K) with the most items sold.
- Grocery stores had the highest item visibility per product.
- Tier 3 outlets contribute the most sales among outlet tiers.
- Low Fat products accounted for 61% of total sales.
- Most outlets were established between 2014 and 2020, with peak growth in 2018.
